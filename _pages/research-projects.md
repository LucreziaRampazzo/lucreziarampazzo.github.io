Here are the details of my most important research projects and internships.

* **2025** - **The Long Term Impact of Parental Job Loss on Children's Education.** (Master's Thesis, _in itinere_) My thesis examines the intergenerational spillovers of involuntary parental job loss on children’s educational trajectories, focusing on the analysis of the timing of parental job loss during childhood and adolescence. 
* **2025** - **Parental Divorce and Children's Educational Trajectories**. This empirical research focuses on understanding the consequences of parental divorce on children's educational pathways across countries and birth cohorts. The project employs GGS and FReDA data and uses a multilevel design for the analysis.

* **2024** - **Prospective Educational Mobility in Italy**. This empirical research focuses on educational and social mobility using longitudinal data from the Bank of Italy, SHIW (Survey on Income and Wealth) and a prospective approach.
