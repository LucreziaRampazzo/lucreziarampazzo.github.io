I am a second-year Masterâ€™s student in **Sociology and Social Research** at the University of Trento, specializing on the quantitative study of social and educational inequalities, intergenerational mobility and life-course processes. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Sociology and Social Sciences at the University of Trento, in 2024, with an empirical thesis analysing prospective approaches and the use of longitudinal data in studying educational mobility in Italy.
My research interests revolve around **Social Inequalities**, **Family Dynamics**, and **Intergenerational Mobility**. I seek to understand how family background, social stratification, early-life conditions, and institutional factors shape life trajectories in education, occupation and family behaviours.

My academic path is fundamentally shaped by the eagerness to understand institutional and social inequalities and their impact in individuals' and families' life. This commitment goes beyond mere academic curiosity. As a first-generation student who maintains that opportunities and life paths should not be left to chance, I aim to contribute evidence-based insights to the scientific community and broader civic discourse, with the hope of informing debates. 
I strongly believe in active scientific dissemination, fostering meaningful dialogue between research and society.

My trajectory is geared toward a PhD to further expand he theoretical and methodological expertise needed to address the complex questions that drive my research interest and academic curiosity. My goal is to build a career that integrates research, teaching, and public engagement with science.
