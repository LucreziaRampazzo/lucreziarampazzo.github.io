I am a second-year Masterâ€™s student in **Sociology and Social Research** at the University of Trento, focusing on the quantitative study of social and educational inequalities, intergenerational mobility and life-course processes. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Sociology and Social Sciences at the University of Trento, in 2024, with an empirical thesis analysing prospective approaches and the use of longitudinal data in studying educational mobility in Italy.
My research interests revolve around **Social Inequalities**, **Family Dynamics**, and **Intergenerational Mobility**. I seek to understand how family background, social stratification, early-life conditions, and institutional factors shape life trajectories in education, occupation and family behaviours.

My academic path is fundamentally shaped by the eagerness to understand institutional and social inequalities and their impact in individuals' and families' life. This commitment goes beyond mere academic curiosity. As a first-generation student who understands that opportunities and life paths should not be left to chance, my research seeks to bring empirical evidence on inequalities and life chances to the civil and social debate, ideally to the political one.
I strongly believe in active scientific dissemination, aiming for a stronger connection and exchange between science and civic society.

My trajectory is geared toward a PhD to further expand the needed theoretical and methodological tools to tackle the complex research question that drive my curiosity. Subsequently, I am leaning toward a career focused around research, teaching, and, in parallel, scientific dissemination.
